# Naive-Bayes-Classifier

One application of Naive Bayes classifiers is for classifying news articles into various categories. A general Na√Øve Bayes classifier was implemented for categorizing news articles as either SPORTS or BUSINESS (i.e., not SPORTS). 

The dataset consists of news articles (http://mlg.ucd.ie/datasets/bbc.html) from a BBC news dataset that have been labeled as either SPORTS or BUSINESS, and which are split into a training set and a testing set. If you open the files, you will see that the first word in each line is the class label and the remainder of the line is the news article.
